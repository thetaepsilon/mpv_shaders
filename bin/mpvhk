# always draw over the entire screen,
# regardless of input video's display aspect ratio.
# note that this by itself (without using a pixel-exact drawing shader)
# will stretch the video across the entire screen without preserving aspect.
# this is typically used with the exact_output shader passes,
# in order to have access to *all* screen pixels -
# mpvhz OTOH will only use the shaders to draw an aspect-preserving area.
