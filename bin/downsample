# shader chain shortcut for obtaining downsampled video.
# checks for variable called "m" which denotes if downsampling should be done.
# this is useful for testing 3D content to emulate rendering that game or such at lower resolution.
# if it is 1 or less, this helper emits nothing.
# otherwise, it will call svar on src/downsample_nearest_multiplier.svar.glsl,
# setting x to the value of m, run it into cs, then echo it as a shader argument.
# this is essentially intended to be used as mpv $(downsample) [other shaders here...].
